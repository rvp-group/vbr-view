# VBR View
VBR Dataset pointclouds visualization using [Potree](https://github.com/potree/potree).
## Requirements
Potree engine is self-contained, but to manage the pointclouds binaries [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.com/) is necessary:
```
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt install -y git-lfs
git lfs install
```
After that, normal git commands can be executed.
